// you'll need a loop. You'll also need the modulus operator (from task 1), you'll need conditional statements (like the if statement)

// A possible approach is for your function create an array, and then push either a number or the words depending on your if statements afterwards you return the array

// WRITE A FUNCTION THAT A WHOLE NUMBER & CHECKS IF 1 TO THAT NUMBER ARE DIVISIBLE BY 2, 3, 5 & REPLACE WITH APPROPRIATE WORD








// RETURN ARRAY CONTAINING ALL NUMBERS FROM 1 TO CHOSEN NUMBER WITH DIVISIBLE NUMBERS REPLACED WITH WORDS







// CALL THE FUNCTION & PASS 100 AS AN ARGUMENT









// CALL THE FUNCTION & PASS A RANDOM NUMBER
